This is the README file for the perl module 'Crypt::PW44.pm'.

PW44 is a password generator that generates 44-bit (quite strong) passwords,
which are easy to remember, being composed of 4 simple, short english words.
The motivation for this module is http://xkcd.com/936 (Password Strength).

See INSTALL for INSTALL instructions.

See contrib/ for example scripts:
"contrib/cgi-bin-genpw.pl" can be put in a web server's cgi-bin, for generating passwords on a web page (probably should be accessed via https !!).
"contrib/genpw" is just a shell script that calls PW44 via a perl one-liner (-e on command line of perl).
